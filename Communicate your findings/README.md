## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found following：

* We can clealy see that rides from san jose travel longer than other two.

* We can clearly see from graph that most people have stated but not completed their ride

* So from map plotting we can see that max number of people end riding bike is from somewhere far from milpitas , san francisco emeryville and berkeley

* So from map plotting we can see that max number of people start riding bike is from san jose , san francisco emeryville and berkeley.
* There are few outliers in label name

* The avgrage distance cover by san francisco is more than other two

* People used electric bike more for longer distance as compare to docked bike 

* From the obtained graph its clear that San francisco has the max distance covered troughout the week days .

* Amongst week days the max distance was on saturday

* From the above graph I can conclude that people traveled max distance on tuesday from san jose

* Most time taken by the rides from San Francisco

* We can clearly see that most number of registraion was  “Customer” that is Casual not “Subscriber” that is Member

* As expected most of the user that might have droped the rides are casual members 

## Key insight 

* MOst of the riders start their rides from 3 ain places including san jose , san francisco emeryville and berkeley and ended at somewhere far from milpitas , san francisco emeryville and berkeley. 

* Rider of san jose traveled longer but the average distance of riders starting from san francisco is more and hence san francisco has the max distance covered in week days .
